## About
42 School project to familiarize ourselves with a recurring problem in programming : the search for an optimal solution from a very big number of possibilities, within a reasonable time.

## How it works
This project organises Tetriminos between themselves to determine the smallest square possible able to hold them.

A Tetriminos is defined as a geometric figure formed of 4 blocs. The possible shapes are the same as in the Tetris game.

Clean:
